IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER MUST NEITHER CLICK “I ACCEPT” NOR INSTALL OR USE ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE.

By entering into the Agreement, Customer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any law or regulation applicable to Customer requiring that the Agreement be localized to meet Customer’s language or requiring an original (non-electronic) signature or delivery or retention of non-electronic records.

1.      License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Khulnasoft grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license, during the subscription-based term stated in the purchase order for the provision of Khulnasoft’s software product identified in the purchase order (“Software“) and Support Services (defined below) executed directly with Khulnasoft (“License Term” and “Purchase Order“, respectively), to do the following for internal business use only (collectively, the “License“): (i) install the Software (in object code only) in Customer’s on-premise, private cloud, or other installation environment stated in the Purchase Order (the “Environment(s)“) and on such number of physical or virtual machine (including without limitation server, host, node and docker engine) on which the Software is installed (“Hosts“) specified in the Purchase Order; and (ii) access and use those modules, tools, and/or features of the Software permitted (and in the quantities permitted) under the Purchase Order (“Module“).

2.      License Restrictions. Except to the extent expressly permitted in this Agreement (or otherwise mandated under any law applicable to Customer), Customer shall not, and shall not permit or encourage any third party to, do any of the following: (a) copy the Software; (b) sell, assign, lease, lend, rent, sublicense, or make available the Software to any third party, or otherwise use the Software to operate in a time-sharing, outsourcing, or service bureau environment; (c) modify, alter, adapt, arrange, translate, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or non-literal aspects (such as the underlying structure, sequence, organization, and interfaces) of, the Software; (d) remove, alter, or conceal, in whole or in part, any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notice or legend displayed or contained on or in the Software; (e) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related or technical features or protocols of the Software (such as usage monitoring features); (f) make a derivative work of the Software, or use the Software to develop any service or product that is the same as (or substantially similar to) the Software; (g) disclose to the public the results of any internal performance testing or benchmarking studies of or about the Software, without first (x) sending the results and related study(ies) to Khulnasoft, and (y) obtaining Khulnasoft’s written approval of the assumptions, methodologies and other parameters of the testing or study; (h) use, publish or transmit any robot, malware, Trojan horse, spyware, or similar malicious item intended (or that has the potential) to damage or disrupt the Software; and/or (i) access the Software and/or its servers through or use with the Software any unauthorized means, services or tools, including, without limitation, any data mining, robots, or similar automated means or data gathering and extraction tools, including, without limitation, in order to extract for re-utilization of any parts of the Software. Customer shall not ship, transfer, or export the Software or any component thereof or use the Software in any manner, prohibited by law, including without limitation to, sell, distribute, export or download the Software: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Lebanon,  Syria, or the Crimea Region of Ukraine, (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S., Australian or Israeli government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval, or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of the U.S., Australia or Israel or any foreign agency or authority.  Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that it is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. The foregoing conditions are limitations on the scope of the License.  

3.      Installation.  Customer will be responsible for the installation, using a license key provided by Khulnasoft, including without limitation: (a) all configurations (including without limitation to the Environment and other third party systems) in connection therewith; and (b) for providing Khulnasoft with (as well as procuring for Khulnasoft the right to access and use) all information, materials, facilities, and equipment reasonably requested by Khulnasoft for the purposes of installation. In addition, Customer will cooperate with Khulnasoft in configuring and maintaining the Software’s remote connectivity Module to enable Khulnasoft to monitor and receive reports regarding Customer’s use and consumption levels of the Software (such monitoring and reports, “Usage Audits”).

4.       Payment

4.1.        License Fees. Customer will pay the Software license fees stated in the Purchase Order (“License Fees“), and in accordance with its payment terms; provided, however, that if a Usage Audit reveals a usage level above that permitted in the Purchase Order, the License Fees will be increased according to Khulnasoft’s then-current price list (and as otherwise specified in the Purchase Order for such excessive use). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing mechanism shall not result in a reduction in License Fees in the event Customer’s consumption level decreases below the level purchased under the Purchase Order. Unless otherwise specified in the Purchase Order, all payments are due thirty (30) days from receipt of each invoice and are non-refundable and without any right of set-off. Any amount not paid when due will accrue interest on a daily basis until paid in full, at the lesser of: (a) the rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month; and (b) the highest amount permitted by applicable law.

4.2.        Taxes. Amounts payable under this Agreement are exclusive of all applicable sales, use, consumption, VAT, GST, and other taxes, duties or governmental charges, except for taxes based upon Khulnasoft’s net income. In the event that Customer is required by applicable law to withhold or deduct taxes imposed upon Customer for any payment under this Agreement, then the amounts due to Khulnasoft will be increased by the amount necessary so that Khulnasoft receives and retains, free from liability for any deduction or withholding, an amount equal to the sum it would have received had Customer not made any such withholding or deduction.

5.       Third Party Software. The Software may include third party software components that are subject to open source and/or pass-through commercial licenses and/or notices (such third party programs, “Third Party Software” and “Third Party Software Terms and Notices“, respectively). Some of the Third Party Software Terms and Notices may be made available to Customer in the Software, its Documentation or via a supplementary list provided by Khulnasoft. Any covenants, representations, warranties, indemnities and other commitments with respect to the Software in this Agreement are made by Khulnasoft and not by any authors, licensors, or suppliers of, or contributors to, such Third Party Software. Any use of Third Party Software is subject solely to the rights and obligations under the applicable Third Party Software Terms and Notices. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Khulnasoft does not make any representation, warranty, guarantee, or condition, and does not undertake any liability or obligation, with respect to any Third Party Software.

6.       Support Services.  Subject to Customer’s timely payment of the License Fees, Khulnasoft will provide the support and maintenance services (“Support Services”) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth at https://www.khulnasoftsec.com/support-terms (“Support Ts&Cs”). 

7.      Confidentiality

7.1.           Customer may have access to certain non-public or proprietary information or materials of Khulnasoft (the “Discloser”), whether in tangible or intangible form (“Confidential Information“). Without derogating from the foregoing, the Software, license keys and terms of the Purchase Order shall be deemed as Khulnasoft’s Confidential Information. Confidential Information will not include information or material which Customer can demonstrate: (a) was in the public domain at the time of disclosure by Khulnasoft to Customer hereunder; and/or (b) became part of the public domain after disclosure by Khulnasoft to Customer hereunder, through no fault of Customer; (c) was in the Customer’s possession at the time of disclosure by the Khulnasoft hereunder, and was not subject to prior continuing obligations of confidentiality by Customer to Khulnasoft; (d) was rightfully disclosed to the Customer by a third party having the lawful right to do so; and/or (e) was independently and rightfully developed by the Recipient without (direct or indirect) use of, or reliance upon, Khulnasoft’s Confidential Information.

7.2.          In the event that Customer is required to disclose Confidential Information of Khulnasoft pursuant to any law or governmental or judicial order, Customer will promptly notify Khulnasoft in writing of such law or order and reasonably cooperate with Khulnasoft in opposing such disclosure or obtaining such other protective measures. In any event, such disclosure made pursuant to this paragraph will be made solely to the extent required by such law or order (as the case may be).

7.3.             Customer will use Khulnasoft’s Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing its obligations and/or exercising its rights under this Agreement and will not disclose or make available the Confidential Information to any third party, except to its employees that have a need to know such information and that are bound by obligations at least as protective as provided herein. Customer will take measures at a level at least as protective as those taken to protect its own confidential information of like nature (but in no event less than a reasonable level) to protect Khulnasoft’s Confidential Information. Customer will promptly notify Khulnasoft in writing in the event of any actual or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure of any Khulnasoft Confidential Information.

7.4.             Each Party acknowledges that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 7 (Confidentiality) by Customer, Khulnasoft may suffer irreparable harm or damage for which monetary damages will be inadequate, and will, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance to enforce the obligations under this Section 7‎7 (Confidentiality) without the need to post a bond.

8.      Ownership.  As between the Parties, Khulnasoft is, and shall remain, the sole and exclusive owner of all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Software and all its copies (as well as any modifications, improvements or derivatives thereto), the Support Services, and any other products or services provided by Khulnasoft (hereinafter, “Khulnasoft IPR“). Khulnasoft reserves all rights not expressly granted herein and except for the License, Customer is granted no other right or license in or to any Khulnasoft IPR. Customer undertakes not to contest Khulnasoft’s ownership in the Khulnasoft IPR. “Intellectual Property Rights” means any and all right, title and interest in and to patents, inventions, discoveries, copyrights, works of authorship, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, technical information, data, know-how, show-how, designs, drawings, utility models, topography and semiconductor mask works, specifications, formulas, methods, techniques, processes, databases, software, code, algorithms, architecture, records, documentation, and other similar intellectual or industrial property, in any form and embodied in any media, whether capable of protection or not, whether registered or unregistered, and including all applications, registrations, renewals, extensions, continuations, divisions or reissues thereof.

9.       Warranty; Disclaimer.  Khulnasoft warrants to Customer that the Software will materially perform the functions described in the technical specifications included in the Documentation for a period of sixty (60) days commencing upon the Effective Date (the “Warranty” and “Warranty Period“, respectively). The following are excluded from the foregoing Warranty: (a) the Software has not been properly installed, operated, repaired or maintained in accordance with the Documentation and the written instructions of Khulnasoft; (b) the Software has been modified by persons other than Khulnasoft or its authorized representatives; and (c) any error or failure related to the Environment or any third party software (including any Third Party Software), hardware or service.

Any fix, patch, or workaround provided as part of the foregoing remedy will not re-commence the Warranty Period and are warranted for the remainder of the Warranty Period, as then in effect.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED OTHERWISE IN THIS SECTION 9 (WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER),‎9 THE SOFTWARE AND ANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUALITY OF SERVICE, OR THAT OTHERWISE ARISE FROM A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE) ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMER. KHULNASOFT DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE OR CONDITION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS, USEFULNESS, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR QUALITY OF THE SOFTWARE, OR THAT USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT ERRORS/BUGS ARE REPRODUCIBLE OR THAT ERRORS/BUGS ARE REPAIRABLE.

10.    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

10.1.     IN NO EVENT WILL KHULNASOFT, ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE FOR: (A) ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; (B) ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS, ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, OR DATA AND/OR DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF REPUTATION, OR GOODWILL; AND/OR (C) THE COST OF PROCURING ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES.

10.2.     THE COMBINED CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF KHULNASOFT AND ITS AFFILIATES AND ANY OF THEIR LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS UNDER, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO KHULNASOFT UNDER THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE ORDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. KHULNASOFT’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IN RESPECT OF ANY MAINTENANCE OR SUPPORT ISSUE SHALL BE LIMITED TO PROVISION OF SUPPORT SERVICES.

10.3.    THE PRECEDING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY, MISAPPROPRIATION OR BREACH OF THE OTHER PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND  OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 (INDEMNIFICATION) HEREIN. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE FOREGOING AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN A PURCHASE ORDER, KHULNASOFT’S LIABILITY UNDER EACH PURCHASE ORDER SHALL BE LIMITED, IN THE AGGREGATE, TO THE GREATER OF (I) TWO TIMES (2X) THE FEES PAID UNDER THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE ORDER TO WHICH THE CLAIMS RELATE, OR (II) ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000).

10.4.     THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND: (A) EVEN IF A PARTY OR AN AFFILIATE OF KHULNASOFT HAS BEEN ADVISED, OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSSES, DAMAGES, OR COSTS; (B) EVEN IF ANY REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; AND (C) REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY).  

11.     Indemnification

11.1.       By Khulnasoft. Khulnasoft will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Customer against any third party demand, claim, suit, or action alleging that Customer’s use of the Software in accordance with this Agreement infringes such third party’s intellectual property rights (an “Infringement Claim“), and Khulnasoft will pay any amounts finally awarded by a court against Customer (or otherwise agreed in settlement) under such Infringement Claim. Khulnasoft will have no obligation or liability under this Section 11.1‎11.1 to the extent that the Infringement Claim is based upon or results from: (a) the combination or use of the Software with any third party products or services if the claim would not have occurred if not for such combination or use; (b) any modification to the Software not made by Khulnasoft; (c) Customer’s failure to comply with the written instructions of Khulnasoft and/or with the terms of this Agreement or the Documentation; (d) where Customer continues the alleged infringing activity after being notified thereof; (e) use or retention of a copy of the Software not in its most current version provided by Khulnasoft; and/or (f) Khulnasoft’s compliance with any Customer instructions or requirements (any such claim in clauses (a) through (d), a “Reverse Infringement Claim“).

11.2.       Remediation. Should the Software (in whole or in part) become, or in Khulnasoft’s opinion be likely to become, the subject of any Infringement Claim, then Customer permits Khulnasoft, at Khulnasoft’s option, either to: (a) obtain for Customer the right to continue using the Software (or part thereof); or (b) replace or modify the Software (or part thereof) so that it becomes non-infringing; provided, however, that if, in Khulnasoft’s opinion, the remedies in clauses (a) and (b) above are not commercially feasible, Khulnasoft may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Customer and provide Customer with a pro-rata refund of any prepaid (but unutilized) License Fees based on the remaining License Term.

11.3.       By Customer. Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Khulnasoft, Khulnasoft Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and suppliers from and against any third party claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, damages, losses, judgments and/or liabilities arising from, or related to or in connection with: (a) a Reverse Infringement Claim; and/or (b) Customer’s unauthorized use of the Software or breach of this Agreement (each, a “Khulnasoft Claim“).

11.4.       Procedure. Each Party’s obligation and liability under this Section  (Indemnification) is subject to the conditions that: (a) the indemnified Party has promptly notified the indemnifying Party in writing of the Infringement Claim or Khulnasoft Claim, as the case may be (as used in this subsection, “Claim“), provided that a delay or failure by the indemnified Party to provide such notice will not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligation or liability under this Section (Indemnification), except to the extent that such delay or failure materially prejudices its ability to defend the claim; (b) the indemnified Party reasonably cooperates with the indemnifying Party and permits the indemnifying Party to assume sole control of the defense of the Claim and all negotiations for any settlement thereof, provided that Khulnasoft will not be required to cede control of a Khulnasoft Claim to the extent that it impacts any Khulnasoft Intellectual Property Right or goodwill, and the indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of a Claim without the indemnified Party’s prior express written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and (c) the indemnified Party refrains from admitting any liability or otherwise compromising the defense of the Claim (in whole or in part), without the prior express written consent of the indemnifying Party.

11.5.        Entire Liability. This Section (Indemnification) states Khulnasoft’s sole and exclusive obligation and liability, and Customer’s sole remedy, with respect to any Infringement Claim.
